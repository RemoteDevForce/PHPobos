A tutorial for building a `staging` and `prod` AWS ECS Stack with Terraform, GitHub, and CI/CD Actions to host, build, and deploy a PHP application based on the gitflow branching development process.

`develop` branch = `staging` env
`main` branch = `prod` env

This is a mono-repo and directories are as follows:

* `.github/workflows` - All the GitHub Action code. Plan/Apply/Build/Destroy Jobs for Infra/ECS/ECR.
* `app` - A highly-experimental Symfony application that creates a portal to another world.
* `docker` - The dockerfile for local & prod containers for our 4th dimension portal app.
* `terraform` - All the terraform code for our AWS ECS Stack.
  * `tf-aws-init` - Start here to create ssh keys & buckets for our state/config files.
  * `tf-aws-infra` - Base infrastructure for AWS such as bastion and ECS servers.
  * `tf-aws-service` - The ECS Service for hosting our application.

## Prerequisites

These examples have only been tested on a Mac but Linux should also work. Windows users can try Linux sub-shell at their own risk.

First make sure you have done the following:

 * Installed Terraform v1+
 * Signed up for AWS and created an Admin IAM Account. 
 * Installed AWS-CLI and setup IAM credentials in `./aws/credentials`
 * `jq` installed locally for config loading in makefiles & the `empty-s3-bucket.sh` script.

## Instructions

Goto the repository page and click "Use this template" to copy it to your own namespace.

Clone down your version of the repo to your machine.

### AWS Init Terraform

On your local machine with aws-cli setup with IAM credentials, do the following:
 1. `cd` into the `terraform/tf-aws-init` and run `make tf-plan-staging`
 1. If things look good, run `make tf-apply-staging` to create the backend tf state s3 buckets.

### AWS Infra Terraform

1. Goto `Repo->Settings->Secrets`
1. Create two secrets in your repo and paste in your IAM credentials `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
1. Goto `Repo->Actions->1 - Terraform Plan - Infrastructure`
1. Run it by clicking `Run workflow` on `develop` for `staging` or `main` for `prod`
1. Check Job Results or `Terraform Plan` in the action to verify & run it by clicking `Run workflow`
1. Check Job Results or `Terraform Apply` in the action to verify it created everything and no errors occurred.

### Docker Build Action

This auto-runs when `develop` or `main` has new changes pushed.
This will build the `./docker/Dockerfile` with `./app` copied into the container.
It finally pushes to `ECR` container repository in AWS created by the AWS Infra Apply Job.
 
### AWS Service Terraform

1. Goto `Repo->Actions->4 - Terraform Plan - Service`
1. Run it by clicking `Run workflow` on `develop` for `staging` or `main` for `prod`
1. Check Job Results or `Terraform Plan` in the action to verify it looks good.
1. Goto `Repo->Actions->5 - Deploy - Terraform Apply - Service` & run it by clicking `Run workflow`
1. Check `Terraform Apply` in the action to copy the `alb_dns`
1. Paste the ALB url your browser to verify your app is working.

### SSH to the ECS Agent Instance

First add an entry in your `.ssh/config` file that has your bastion IP and tell it to forward your SSH Agent.

```
Host staging-phpobos
 HostName 34.208.225.123       #(replace with your bastion public IP address)
 User ec2-user
 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa    #(replace if you used a different key)
 ForwardAgent yes
```

Then head over to you [EC2 Dashboard](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#Instances:sort=instanceId) and select on of the *-ecs-asg instances to copy the private IP address.

SSH to bastion `ssh ec2-user@bastion.ip.address.here` and then once on the server, SSH to the private ip of the ECS EC2 Instance `ssh ec2-user@ecs.instance.ip.here`

Then you can run `docker ps` once on an ECS Host to make sure you see the ecs-agent running.

## Getting Production Ready

I would recommended reviewing ALL files. A few things I can think of are:

 * Restrict GitHub IAM Keys to just have what is needed (God Made aka `Administrator Access` is not recommended) 
 * Add TF state locking via DynamoDB - [read more](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/s3.html)
 * Add Encryption to ECR, ALB, ECS, etc.
   * Add SSL to ALB (Best to host domain DNS with Route53 and use AWS Certificate Manager)
 * Add an RDS config in tf-aws-infra
 * Blue/Green Deployment (faster rollback)
 * Inject `.env.local` or environment variable overrides to configure staging/prod app
